// Matrix Search    or    Staircase Search
/*

Given a matrix of integers A of size N x M and an integer B.
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for integar B in matrix A.
This matrix A has the following properties:
Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than or equal to the last integer of the previous row.
Return 1 if B is present in A, else return 0.
Note: Rows are numbered from top to bottom and columns are numbered from left to right.
