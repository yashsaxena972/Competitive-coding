// Intersecting Chords in a Circle
/*

Given a number A, return number of ways you can draw A chords in a circle with 2 x A points such that no 2 chords intersect.

Two ways are different if there exists a chord which is present in one way and not in other.

Return the answer modulo 109 + 7.

Input 1:
    A = 1

Output 1:
    1

Explanation 1:
    If points are numbered 1 to 2 in clockwise direction, then different ways to draw chords are:
    {(1-2)} only.
    So, we return 1.

Input 2:
    A = 2

Output 2:
    2

Explanation 2:
    If points are numbered 1 to 4 in clockwise direction, then different ways to draw chords are:
    {(1-2), (3-4)} and {(1-4), (2-3)}.
    So, we return 2.
