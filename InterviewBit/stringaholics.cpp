You are given an array A consisting of strings made up of the letters ‘a’ and ‘b’ only.
Each string goes through a number of operations, where:

1.  At time 1, you circularly rotate each string by 1 letter.
2.  At time 2, you circularly rotate the new rotated strings by 2 letters.
3.  At time 3, you circularly rotate the new rotated strings by 3 letters.
4.  At time i, you circularly rotate the new rotated strings by i % length(string) letters.

Eg: String is "abaa"

1.  At time 1, string is "baaa", as 1 letter is circularly rotated to the back
2.  At time 2, string is "aaba", as 2 letters of the string "baaa" is circularly rotated to the back
3.  At time 3, string is "aaab", as 3 letters of the string "aaba" is circularly rotated to the back
4.  At time 4, string is again "aaab", as 4 letters of the string "aaab" is circularly rotated to the back
5.  At time 5, string is "aaba", as 1 letters of the string "aaab" is circularly rotated to the back

A: [a,ababa,aba]
Output

4

String 'a' is it's original self at time 1, 2, 3 and 4.
String 'ababa' is it's original self only at time 4. (ababa => babaa => baaba => babaa => ababa)
String 'aba' is it's original self at time 2 and 4. (aba => baa => aba)

Hence, 3 strings are their original self at time 4.
