// Largest area of rectangle with permutations
/*

Given a binary grid A of size N x M consisting of 0's and 1's, find the area of the largest rectangle inside the grid such that all the cells inside the chosen rectangle should have 1 in them.

You are allowed to permutate the columns matrix i.e. you can arrange each of the column in any order in the final grid.

    1 0 1
    0 1 0
    1 0 0


At present we can see that max rectangle satisfying the criteria mentioned in the problem
 is of 1 * 1 = 1 area i.e either of the 4 cells which contain 1 in it.



Now since we are allowed to permutate the columns of the given matrix, we can take column 1
 and column 3 and make them neighbours. One of the possible configuration of the grid can be:
 1 1 0
 0 0 1
 1 0 0



Now In this grid, first column is column 1, second column is column 3 and third column
 is column 2 from the original given grid.



Now, we can see that if we calculate the max area rectangle, we get max area as 1 * 2 = 2
 which is bigger than the earlier case. Hence 2 will be the answer in this case.
